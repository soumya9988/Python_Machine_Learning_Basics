Today I went to the zoo. I saw a(n) ADJECTIVE NOUN jumping up and down in its tree.
He VERB almost through the large tunnel that led to its ADJECTIVE NOUN.
I got some peanuts and passed them through the cage to a gigantic gray NOUN towering above my head.
Feeding that animal made me hungry. I went to get a ADJECTIVE scoop of ice cream. It filled my stomach.
Afterwards I had to VERB ADVERB to catch our bus. When I got home I VERB my mom for a ADJECTIVE day at the zoo.

Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an) ADJECTIVE amusement park.
It was a fun park with lots of cool NOUN and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor
shouted loudly, "Everybody off the NOUN." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry.
My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited!
I couldn't figure out what exciting thing to do first.
I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so, I ADVERB ran over to get in the long line that had
about 100 people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was VERB.
In fact I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together.
This was the ADJECTIVE ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.
Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little VERB but I was proud of myself.
The rest of the day went ADVERB. It was a(n) ADJECTIVE day at the fun park.
